`NOT AN OFFICIAL PIXERA REPO!`

# Pixera shaders and control repository
Pixera has a large amount of shaders, and that seems like it is only going to grow. I created a python script to document the glsl shaders in a markdown file for reference. Running the script in the directory with the shaders and reference images of the same name - as well as a "description.csv" in the directory above will generate an _effect_overview.md.

## Shaders
